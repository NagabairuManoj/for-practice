        <h3>Empires of Antiquity</h3>
        <p>India witnessed several powerful empires, such as the Maurya and Gupta Empires. The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka is renowned for his propagation of Buddhism and his rock edicts that espoused moral values and religious tolerance.</p>
        <h3>Medieval Dynasties</h3>
